 Percona XtraDB Cluster Errata 
===============================

Known Issues
-------------

Following are issues which may impact you while running PXC:
 - Create Table As Select (CTAS) can cause deadlocks and server hang when used with explicit TEMPORARY tables.
 - bug :bug:`1226185`: percona-xtrabackup-20 may get installed as a dependency instead of latest percona-xtrabackup during a fresh install due to certain yum issues. This can be avoided by specifying ``percona-xtrabackup`` explicitly in the install command line.
 - bug :bug:`1192834`: Joiner may crash after SST from donor with compaction enabled. Workaround is to disable the index compaction (compact under [xtrabackup]), if enabled. This crash requires specific configuration, hence you may not be affected. Also, this doesn't require any fix from PXC, but Xtrabackup with the fix included should do.
 - bug :bug:`1098566`: :variable:`innodb_data_home_dir`/:variable:`innodb_log_group_home_dir` is not supported. Depends on bug :bug:`1164945` for the fix.

Also make sure to check limitations page :ref:`here <limitations>`. You can also review this `milestone <https://launchpad.net/percona-xtradb-cluster/+milestone/future-5.5>`_ for features/bugfixes to be included in future releases (i.e. releases after the upcoming/recent release).

Incompatibilities
-------------------

Following are incompatibilities between PXC 5.5.33 (and higher) and older versions:
 - wsrep_sst_donor now supports comma separated list of nodes as a consequence of bug :bug:`1129512`. This only affects if you use this option as a list. This is not compatible with nodes running older PXC, hence **entire** cluster will be affected as far as SST is concerned, since donor nodes won't recognise the request from joiner nodes if former are not upgraded. Minimal workaround is to upgrade Galera package or to not use this new feature (wsrep_sst_donor with single node can still be used). However, upgrading the full PXC is strongly recommended, however, just upgrading PXC galera package will do for this.
