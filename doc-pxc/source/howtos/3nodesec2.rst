How to setup 3 node cluster in EC2 enviroment
==============================================

This is how to setup 3-node cluster in EC2 enviroment.

Assume you are running *m1.xlarge* instances with OS *Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 64-bit*.
Make sure to remove existing PXC-5.5 and PS-5.5/5.6 packages before proceeding.

Install XtraDB Cluster from RPM:

1. Install Percona's regular and testing repositories: ::

        rpm -Uhv http://repo.percona.com/testing/centos/6/os/noarch/percona-testing-0.0-1.noarch.rpm
        rpm -Uhv http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-release/percona-release-0.0-1.x86_64.rpm

2. Install Percona XtraDB Cluster packages: ::

        yum install Percona-XtraDB-Cluster-server Percona-XtraDB-Cluster-client percona-xtrabackup

3. Create data directories: ::

        mkdir -p /mnt/data
        mysql_install_db --datadir=/mnt/data --user=mysql

4. Stop firewall. Cluster requires couple TCP ports to operate. Easiest way: :: 

        service iptables stop

If you want to open only specific ports, you need to open 3306, 4444, 4567, 4568 ports.
For example for 4567 port (substitute 192.168.0.1 by your IP): ::

        iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --source 192.168.0.1/24 --dport 4567 -j ACCEPT


5. Create /etc/my.cnf files.

 On the first node (assume IP 10.93.46.58): ::

  [mysqld_safe]
  wsrep_urls=gcomm://10.93.46.58:4567,gcomm://10.93.46.59:4567,gcomm://10.93.46.60:4567,gcomm://  

  [mysqld]
  datadir=/mnt/data
  user=mysql

  binlog_format=ROW

  wsrep_provider=/usr/lib64/libgalera_smm.so

  wsrep_slave_threads=2
  wsrep_cluster_name=trimethylxanthine
  wsrep_sst_method=rsync
  wsrep_node_name=node1

  innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog=1
  innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2

 On the second node (assume IP 10.93.46.59): ::

  [mysqld_safe]
  wsrep_urls=gcomm://10.93.46.58:4567,gcomm://10.93.46.59:4567,gcomm://10.93.46.60:4567,gcomm://

  [mysqld]
  datadir=/mnt/data
  user=mysql

  binlog_format=ROW

  wsrep_provider=/usr/lib64/libgalera_smm.so

  wsrep_slave_threads=2
  wsrep_cluster_name=trimethylxanthine
  wsrep_sst_method=rsync
  wsrep_node_name=node2

  innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog=1
  innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2

On the third (and following nodes) config is similar, with the following change: ::

  wsrep_node_name=node3

In this example variable :variable:`wsrep_urls` is being used instead of :variable:`wsrep_cluster_address`. With this configuration, node will first try to reach a cluster on `10.93.46.58:4567` if there is no cluster node, then it will try on `10.93.46.59:4567` and then `10.93.46.60:4567`. If no nodes are up, it will start a new cluster. Variable :variable:`wsrep_urls` goes into the [mysql_safe] section so it's important that the mysql server instance is started with the `/bin/mysql_safe` and not `bin/mysqld`.

6. Start mysqld_safe

On the first node: ::

   mysqld_safe

You should be able to see in console (or in error-log file): ::

  111216  0:16:42 [Note] /usr/sbin/mysqld: ready for connections.
  Version: '5.5.17'  socket: '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock'  port: 3306  Percona XtraDB Cluster (GPL), Release alpha22.1, Revision 3673 wsrep_22.3.r3673

  111216  0:16:42 [Note] WSREP: Synchronized with group, ready for connections

On the second (and following nodes): ::

   mysqld_safe

You should be able to see in console (or in error-log file): ::

When all nodes are in SYNCED stage your cluster is ready!

7. Connect to database on any node and create database: ::

        $ mysql -uroot
        > CREATE DATABASE hello_tom;

The new database will be propagated to all nodes.

Enjoy!
