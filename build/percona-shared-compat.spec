%description
This package includes the shared libraries for MySQL 4.0, 4.1, 5.0 and 5.1.
Install this package instead of "MySQL-shared", if you have applications
installed that are dynamically linked against older versions of the MySQL
client library but you want to upgrade to MySQL %{version} without breaking the
library dependencies.
