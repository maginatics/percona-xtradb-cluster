==============================
Prevent Caching to FlashCache
==============================

`FlashCache <https://github.com/facebook/flashcache/blob/master/doc/flashcache-doc.txt>`_ increases performance by caching data on SSDs. It works even better when only hot data is cached. This feature prevents the caching of the unwanted blocks of data.

Better utilization of *FlashCache* partitions is achieved when caching of rarely used data is avoided. Use of this feature prevents blocks of data from being cached to *FlashCache* during a query.

Usage of the feature is as follows: ::

  SELECT /* sql_no_fcache */ ... 

The :command:`mysqldump` binary was changed to use this option.
